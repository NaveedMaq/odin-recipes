    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Aab Gosh, also known as Aab Gosht or <strong>Kashmiri Mutton Curry</strong> is a delicious dish where mutton pieces are cooked in a milk based gravy with a hint of spice in the form of black pepper. It is usually eaten as part of the traditional kashmiri cuisine. The dish when eaten oozes out gravy into the mouth giving a really nice taste</p>

    <p>The origin of the Kashmir's ethnic/heritage cuisine—<strong>wazwan</strong>—dates back to the 14th century when the Mongol ruler Timur invaded India in 1348 during the reign of Nasiuddin Muhammad of the Tughlaq dynasty, who brought skilled persons of various professions including cooks from <em>Samarkand</em> to <em>Kashmir</em>. These skilled cooks, called wazas in the local language, cooked meat into various dishes and classified them according to shape and gravies used for their preparation. The credit for popularizing wazwan dishes goes to Persian and Sanskrit immigrants. The term waazi is basically a Sanskrit term waja, which means to cook. The origin of the term has also been derived from a Persian word, ashpaaz, which means a special cook proficient in making soups, and with the passage of time the term became waza</p>

    <p>The Kashmiri wazwan has been influenced by various cultural migrants that have swept into Kashmir from time to time. The names of the wazwan dishes reflect Persian, Turkish, Arabic, and Central Asian influences. The term kabab is Arabic in origin, Korma has Turkish roots, and rogan josh, yakhni, aab gosh, rista, and goshtaba stem from Persian sources. Various spices are used for the preparation and processing of wazwan: shonth (dried ginger), dalchini (cinnamon), elaichi (cardamom), laung (cloves), badyan (fennel), etc. The spices used in its preparation give special taste and aroma and suggest its Sanskrit influence </p>
